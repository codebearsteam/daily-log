Today we went deeper into some new rspec concepts. The notifications specs are written a with new syntax we did not met in the specs we worked on so far. We had a great white board session with our coach about mocks in rspec. [This documentation](http://rspec.info/documentation/3.6/rspec-mocks/) was helpful. After the theory we played with the spec we wrote in `contacts_birthday_spec.rb` in order to practice what we learned. We made the test fail some times and then made it green again.

Now we feel much more ready to write tests for the rest of our feature.

### September 5th
Today we wrote the test for the notification we created yesterday. It was challenging because the rspec syntax was a bit different than what we are use to. Through working on the tests we realized that some things in our actual implementation were wrong and we fixed them (GO TDD). Now we have a notification and a spec for it. Next steps are:
1. Create a test for a worker and a worker.
2. Create a test for a mailer and a mailer.
3. Enable the user to turn off birthday notifications emails.

### September 4th
Neta is back, yay! So nice to be working as a team again :)
Today we solved the first step in our plan for the current issue: created a new notification type in `app/models/notifications` and made it work through the console. For tomorrow we will write the tests for this new notification type and then create a worker that calls the notify method with the users contacts as recipients when a user has their birthday.
