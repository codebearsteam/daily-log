### August 7th ###

Today we started the day with recapturing what we did on Friday. We decided that we need to understand more of Backbone.js so we started watching tutorials on this JavaScript library.
In the afternoon we started looking at our solution from Friday especially with respect to the database query. We got the hint that we should make one query instead of two, so we would have to do a JOIN. So we first looked at the psql console to learn about JOINS and then went to the Rails console to see how JOINS work in Rails. Tomorrow we will go back to our code and see how we can change the query using a JOIN.
