## Issue #4888  ##


### July 18th ###

We started to work today on [this issue](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/4888). It involves a list of issues regarding poll features. We read the issue and the entire discussion alongside testing polls creation on our own diaspora profiles, and came up with a list of 9(!) improvements. In our coaching session we divided the list to two categories:

Visual issues:
1. radio buttons alignment.
2. delete icons alignment.
3. enable label voting (in the discussion on the issue it is said that this is solved but it actually doesn't work in the poll we created).

Missing behaviors:
1. enable to shut down poll/time limit voting.
2. mark the option the user voted for.
3. enable mobile voting.
4. enable re-sharing poll (like any other status).
5. enable to edit privacy settings after poll was created.
6. enable to publish the poll without wring a status (there is already a field for the poll question, so adding a status on top of that seems sometimes unnecessary).     

We don't know if we actually will tackle all those issues, and we still need to choose some and prioritize.

In any case, after a quick look at the code we have realized we need to learn about Active Records and ORM, so we are looking at some videos and tutorials:
* [Rails guide for Active Records](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
* [envato tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/active-record-the-rails-database-bridge--net-30489)
* [Rails cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96RIkuwA1h0)
