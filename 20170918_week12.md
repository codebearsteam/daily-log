### September 18th
Today we made some amazing progress on our issue. After struggling a lot with the different methods in workers, mailers and so on, we figured out why our test was not passing. We actually solved a list of 6 steps that we had written to ourselves last week (and we thought it would take us at least 3 days to finish :) ):
- draw a birthday notification life cycle and compare to another notifications (see below)
- figure out where to add an argument in the send_notification method
- finish the mailer specs
- add the view template for the email
- add possibility to choose if user wants to receive an email notification
- add a date to the text in the translation file (including a new method to call the date)- in order to finalize the notification itself.

We still need to:
* Contact diaspora community to figure out the attributes of a `contact` object and find out about an index for the birthday column in the DB, to make the `check_birthday` worker faster.
* Write tests for the email notification preferences.  

*Birthday notification- files involved on the back-end*:
Here are the files involved in sending a BD notification:
1. `check_birthday.rb` in app/workers/, method called: `.notify(type, [])`
2. `contact_birthday.rb` in app/models/notifications/, methods called: `.create_notification(recipient, target, actor)` and `.email_the_user(target, actor)`.
3. `notification.rb` in app/models/, methods called: `self.create_notification` => notification is sent, and `.mail(mail_job, recipient, target, actor)`.
4. `user.rb` in app/models/, method called: `perform_async(*args)`.
5. `contacts_birthday.rb` in app/workers/mail/, which inherits from `notifier_base`.
6. `notifier_base.rb` in app/workers/mail/, method called: `send_notification(type, *args)`.
7. `notifier.rb` in app/mailers/, methods called: `.new(*args)`
8. `base.rb` in app/mailers/notification_mailers/, methods called `initialize(recipient_id, sender_id=nil, *args)` and `.set_headers(*args)`
9. `contacts_birthday.rb` in app/mailers/notification_mailers/ => email is sent!!!
