Today we did come recap on CSS and got an introduction to SCSS from one of our coaches. This was very helpful to understand the CSS in our code. We then went over to editing the css in our code so the progress bar would change color instead of the text. The only thing left on this end, is to remove one line of code regarding different color themes that the user can choose in their profile.
In the afternoon we started looking at the Jasmine tests and realized that we had many many failures because we didnÂ´t use an if-statement when extending our defaultPresenter. After solving this we have 4 Jasmine tests failing which we left for tomorrow. We will also start adding our own Jasmine tests for the Javascript we wrote.

We focused on writing rspecs for our ruby code for this issue. We had to refresh our memory a bit but at the end we wrote two tests: `poll_spec.rb:27` and `post_presenter_spec.rb:90`. The most complicated thing was to create all the relevant variables for the tests. The coaching session was very helpful for that.
We also learned a-lot about how to use a debugger in order figure out what is not working. We also learned what possible problems that could rise from using the `id` attribute and how to avoid using it as much as possible.  
Even though it was a bit slow, at the end of the day we have two good tests on the back-end side. The challenge for this week would be to write front-end tests, which we never did before.
