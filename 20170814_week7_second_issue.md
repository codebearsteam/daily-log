### August 14th ###

We focused on writing rspecs for our ruby code for this issue. We had to refresh our memory a bit but at the end we wrote two tests: `poll_spec.rb:27` and `post_presenter_spec.rb:90`. The most complicated thing was to create all the relevant variables for the tests. The coaching session was very helpful for that.
We also learned a-lot about how to use a debugger in order figure out what is not working. We also learned what possible problems that could rise from using the `id` attribute and how to avoid using it as much as possible.  
Even though it was a bit slow, at the end of the day we have two good tests on the beck-end side. The challenge for this week would be to write front-end tests, which we never did before.
