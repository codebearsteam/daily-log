### July 25th ###

We got our first PR merged!!!! :) What a nice message in the morning after so many fixing cycles...
Then we continued learning about databases and ActiveRecord. Also we continued writing our first blog post.
In the afternoon we had our next session about git which was very helpful again and we think we are on our way to understand better why we are having so much trouble with it.
Tomorrow we will start looking at the sub-issue that we picked from our next issue, which will deal with databases and ActiveRecord


### July 24th ###

We spent half a day with finalizing the fixes for the 6559 issue PR and pushed it after re-basing and squashing. We hope that those are the final touches and that we will have a merge soon :)

We started last week to look at [this issue](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/4888). It involves a list of issues regarding poll features. We read the issue and the entire discussion alongside testing polls creation on our own diaspora profiles, and came up with a list of 9(!) improvements. In our coaching session last week we divided the list to two categories:

Visual issues:
1. radio buttons alignment.
2. delete icons alignment.
3. enable label voting (in the discussion on the issue it is said that this is solved but it actually doesn't work in the poll we created).

Missing behaviors:
1. enable to shut down poll/time limit voting.
2. mark the option the user voted for.
3. enable mobile voting.
4. enable re-sharing poll (like any other status).
5. enable to edit privacy settings after poll was created.
6. enable to publish the poll without wring a status (there is already a field for the poll question, so adding a status on top of that seems sometimes unnecessary).

After a quick look at the code we have realized we need to learn about Active Records and ORM, so we are looking at some videos and tutorials:
* [Rails guide for Active Records](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
* [envato tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/active-record-the-rails-database-bridge--net-30489)
* [Rails cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96RIkuwA1h0)
* [LaunchCode introduction to ORM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHQ-I7kr_SY)
* [Linda Ruby on Rails course](https://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Understanding-ActiveRecord-ActiveRelation/139989/159093-4.html)

At today's coaching session we decided to pick up the issue regarding marking the option the user voted for and start from there.
We had an intro coaching session on ActivRecords and continued researching the topic ourselves.

Also we had to work only with one computer because the other is still down. We spent some time trying to figure that out as-well...
