### July 28th ###

Today was mainly about practicing what we have learned the past week and then learning some more:
1. Git: practiced git commands with one remote on a [mock repo](https://github.com/codebearsteam/git-playground) we opened in our organization - merge, rebase, fetch, pull, push and friends. Next step would be to practice with two remotes, like the flow we have on diaspora. 
2. Rails console: after learning some commands the day before, it was time for some independent practice with diaspora's code. Of-course we encountered some problems with validations, which made us dig into diaspora's code and understand it better :). 
3. Ruby on Rails [on-line course](https://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Introducing-Ruby-Rails/139989/159041-4.html): this course is very helpful so far. In the past week we were watching parts of the chapters about db, migrations, models, ActiveRecordsand ActiveRelation and associations. We still have a way to go but this course is a good start.
4. HAML: started looking into [HAML](http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html) which is how the views on diaspora are written. Probably we need to add some code to the poll views, so we need to understand them first ;). 

We hope next week to crate enough fake polls data in order to test the behavior of the polls on diaspora and then finally get to solving the issue itself.

### July 27th ###

Today we spent quite some time getting the blog post uploaded as we had some problems with Jekyll Versions. In parallel we worked on bringing one of our laptops back to life, which was more or less successful as this is being written on the laptop concerned. Even all git configurations are still there. Just some problems with rights which will be solved hopefully soon.
Then we had a session about databases, created a fake poll via Rails Console and practiced some git exercises from Tuesday's coaching session.

### July 26th ###

The stuff we did today:
1. Issue #4888: The issue regards showing the user's vote on the poll area. In order to figure out where exactly code is missing we looked and asked the following questions:   
    a. Is there a table in the DB that stores the user's vote? the database schema showed that the `poll_participations` table actually stores this info. YAY.  
    b. Can the `poll_participation.rb` or the `poll_participation_controller.rb` files indicate that this info is actually saved? we assumed that it is but we need to test it. to do that- we need to make some fake users locally and we started doing so.  
    c. last step would be to look at the views.
    so far it seems like this issue is more about missing code in the views than about db and logics- but we still have some more figure outing to do before we really know what code is missing and where.   
2. Had another general introduction to ActiveRecords terms: belongs_to, has_one, has_many in order to understand better the tables structure of diaspora.
3. Read [this](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/An_introduction_to_the_Diaspora_source) guide to diaspora's models structure which helped us to understand a bit more about the app.  
4. Broken computer: there is a new drive!!! just need to check that the back-up actually has all the configurations.  
5. We finished writing the blog post! Just need to push it to github :).

Plan for tomorrow:
1. Keep making fake data to test with diaspora's poll features.
2. have a third git session with our git expert coach.
3. push blog post to github.
4. If there is time left - keep learning about db.

######remember to ask coaches tomorrow ######:
when we tried to run diaspora locally, we got this error message: “Migrations are pending; run 'bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development' to resolve this issue.”
as suggested there we ran the migration. good news- it worked! but, now our migration folder is changed. How do we handle this gitwise?

### July 25th ###

We got our first PR merged!!!! :) What a nice message in the morning after so many fixing cycles...
Then we continued learning about databases and ActiveRecord. Also we continued writing our first blog post.
In the afternoon we had our next session about git which was very helpful again and we think we are on our way to understand better why we are having so much trouble with it.
Tomorrow we will start looking at the sub-issue that we picked from our next issue, which will deal with databases and ActiveRecord

### July 24th ###

We spent half a day with finalizing the fixes for the 6559 issue PR and pushed it after re-basing and squashing. We hope that those are the final touches and that we will have a merge soon :)

We started last week to look at [this issue](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/4888). It involves a list of issues regarding poll features. We read the issue and the entire discussion alongside testing polls creation on our own diaspora profiles, and came up with a list of 9(!) improvements. In our coaching session last week we divided the list to two categories:

Visual issues:
1. radio buttons alignment.
2. delete icons alignment.
3. enable label voting (in the discussion on the issue it is said that this is solved but it actually doesn't work in the poll we created).

Missing behaviors:
1. enable to shut down poll/time limit voting.
2. mark the option the user voted for.
3. enable mobile voting.
4. enable re-sharing poll (like any other status).
5. enable to edit privacy settings after poll was created.
6. enable to publish the poll without wring a status (there is already a field for the poll question, so adding a status on top of that seems sometimes unnecessary).

After a quick look at the code we have realized we need to learn about Active Records and ORM, so we are looking at some videos and tutorials:
* [Rails guide for Active Records](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
* [envato tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/active-record-the-rails-database-bridge--net-30489)
* [Rails cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96RIkuwA1h0)
* [LaunchCode introduction to ORM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHQ-I7kr_SY)
* [Linda Ruby on Rails course](https://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Understanding-ActiveRecord-ActiveRelation/139989/159093-4.html)

At today's coaching session we decided to pick up the issue regarding marking the option the user voted for and start from there.
We had an intro coaching session on ActivRecords and continued researching the topic ourselves.

Also we had to work only with one computer because the other is still down. We spent some time trying to figure that out as-well...
