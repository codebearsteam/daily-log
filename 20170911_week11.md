### September 15th
We started the day just where we left yesterday: tracking the path of one Bday notification. Apparently 9 files are involved in this on the server side. We still did not find our missing/wrong code, but some questions came up. Next thing to do would be to compare the Bday notification path to another notification path and see if there is a difference.
Here are the files involved in sending a BD notification:
1. `check_birthday.rb` in app/workers/, method called: `.notify(type, [])`
2. `contact_birthday.rb` in app/models/notifications/, methods called: `.create_notification(recipient, target, actor)` and `.email_the_user(target, actor)`.
3. `notification.rb` in app/models/, methods called: `self.create_notification` => notification is sent, and `.mail(mail_job, recipient, target, actor)`.
4. `user.rb` in app/models/, method called: `perform_async(*args)`.
5. `contacts_birthday.rb` in app/workers/mail/, which inherits from `notifier_base`.
6. `notifier_base.rb` in app/workers/mail/, method called: `send_notification(type, *args)`.
7. `notifier.rb` in app/mailers/, methods called: `.new(*args)`
8. `base.rb` in app/mailers/notification_mailers/, methods called `initialize(recipient_id, sender_id=nil, *args)` and `.set_headers(*args)`
9. `contacts_birthday.rb` in app/mailers/notification_mailers/ => email is sent!!!

### September 14th
Today we decided to leave the worker tests behind for now and started working on the mailers. We successfully did a TDD cycle for the first part of this. Then we got a bit stuck on understanding one method, because the test keep telling us that needed to give one more argument. So we followed the path of the mailer, and found one method that needs one more argument. Now we need to find out how to pass this argument, since we are not calling the method directly. But it seems that we did some progress on the issue today. We also made a plan on all the steps that are missing to solve the issue.

Today we tried to understand in detail what the destroy method on a contact does. Our data model is sometimes quite confusing, since there are Users, and each user has a profile and a person. The person is the user viewed from the outside. So we had some confusion about what is a contact and what receiving and sharing means for each contact. We figured it out in the end more or less, but we will contact the community to make sure that we got it right. Next step then is the mailers.

### September 12th
We finished writing the worker tests. We had to set a test where the user don't have a contact, and spent quite some time realizing how to do that. But, we managed to understand the test helper and how to use it best in order to set up the tests. We still need to make sure we are using the right method in the worker, but other than that this part is done and we can move on to the mailer.
