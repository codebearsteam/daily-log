### August 22nd ###

This morning we finished working on the avatar issue we started yesterday - you can take a look at the result [here](https://github.com/codebearsteam/daily-log/blob/master/assets/with_avatar_inline.png).
We also wrote a test for it and ran the required tests before pushing the code. Now we are waiting for another review on our code from the diaspora community. Here you can find the [PR](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/7550)  
Then we started choosing our next issue. We looked at a lot of issues and narrowed down the options to a short-list at our coaching session:  
https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/7471  
https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/7413  
https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/4986  
https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/7332

We still need to discuss this short list. The main considerations now are:
* pick an issue we could end till the end of the summer
* pick an issue/issues where we can try working separately after working closely (and successfully) so far


### August 21st ###

After opening the PR [https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/7550] last Thursday, we got some feedback on small things to fix. We did this in the morning. Then we decided to have a look at one more small feature regarding this issue, which was to add the userÂ´s avatar next to the option they voted for. It took us the rest of the day, so in the end we were only left with finding the right part of the css to change the layout. We will do this first thing in the morning tomorrow. Then hopefully move on to the next issue :)
