### August 21st ###

After opening the PR [https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/7550] last Thursday, we got some feedback on small things to fix. We did this in the morning. Then we decided to have a look at one more small feature regarding this issue, which was to add the userÂ´s avatar next to the option they voted for. It took us the rest of the day, so in the end we were only left with finding the right part of the css to change the layout. We will do this first thing in the morning tomorrow. Then hopefully move on to the next issue :)
