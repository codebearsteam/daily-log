### Hi students, mentors, coaches and friends,

We had our second retrospective, the positive topics included merging the first PR, working in the new issue and learning topics side by side with working in Diaspora. The negative topics revolved around HW problems, booking meeting rooms and the setup guide. You can see them in full detail in out #general Slack channel.

##### The action points from the last retrospective we consider done/keep doing are:
* Dani, Jano: Send calendar invites for coaching sessions.
* Neta, Rete: Announce issue and learning topics.
* Neta, Rete: Chat to coaches the day before for preparation (the practice changed to speak at any moment before the actual session)
* All coaches: Switch learning assignments between reading, watching, working and exercising.
* All coaches: Recommend step by step guides for beginners (with steps!!!)

##### The action points from the last retrospective we didn't have enough information to close:
* Chiara: Share coach info on Slack.

##### The NEW action points are:
* Coaches: Book your meeting rooms in advance.
* Neta, Rete: Express level of urgency in the questions (e.g. this is blocking me).
* Jano: Send an email reminding the "firefighter" role of coaches (Please read the next section).
* Coaches: Send the vacation schedule (Please read next section).

I've sent an invite for the next retrospective and our facilitator will be Dani, see you in two weeks!

#### IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR COACHES:
* Please send an update on your vacation plans so we can shuffle around our coaching schedule.
* Remember that they day you are coaching, you should are the first responder on Slack in case of questions from our students, if you are not available other coach can help them.
